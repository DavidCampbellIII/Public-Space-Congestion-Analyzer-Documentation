Advanced User Settings Advanced User Settings are settings that should not be changed or reconfigured unless the user knows exactly what they are doing. All Advanced User Settings are specifically labeled on all settings defined in these docs. These settings are already configured, and the average user should NEVER need to change them. Changing Advanced User Settings can easily break the entire simulation if not careful. Not all configurable parts of this program are listed in this documentation. It is restricted to only the most essential pieces that the average user will be required to understand and configure. Weights Many elements of this program use the concept of weights. This is a way to assign a certain basis that an element will be selected randomly from a group of other elements. Whenever a weight is used in relation to something in this program, it does NOT represent a percent chance that element will be selected. Rather, it represents the weight relative to the weights of the other elements in the group that it will be selected. For example, if two elements in a list have a weight of 1, this does not mean they both have a 100% chance of being selected, but rather that they both have an equal chance of being selected. This is because relative to one another, they have the same weight, with each of their respective weights making up 50% of the total weight of the group (which also gives them each a 50% chance of spawning). Similarly, if one element in a group has a weight of 0.5, and the another has a weight of 0.05, it does not mean they have a respective chance of 50% and 5% of being selected. That would only equate to 55%, meaning 45% of the time, nothing would be selected (which doesn't make much sense). Instead, the total weight pool of all elements in the group is 0.55. The element with the weight of 0.5 makes up roughly 90% of the total weight pool, which means the element with a weight of 0.05 has only about a 10% chance of spawning relative to the first. Simulation Limitations Currently, the simulation has a few limitations in its functionality. Here are the most noticeable: Long queues that push into walls perpendicular to the average direction of the queue don't always wrap correctly Poor performance when using the ALWAYS local avoidance type. This is unavoidable without huge changes to the underlying agent logic to convert it to an ECS-based architecture.

First, add in all objects to the scene with their colliders, and ensure they are marked static. Next, be sure to rebake the Nav Mesh. Finally, set up the camera so all areas of the simulation environment area viewable. Import Objects Place Objects and Add Colliders Mark Objects as Static Rebake Nav Mesh Configure Pathfinding Grid Set Up Simulation Camera Note: Steps 3 and 4 must be preformed every time anything about the environment changes. If an object is added, moved, or removed, ensure all objects are still static, and rebake the Nav Mesh. Importing Objects into the Unity Project To import objects into the Unity project, create a folder in the Project Panel for your assets. The folder \"Raw Imports\" contains the currently imported assets. Right-click in the desired folder and select the \"Import New Asset\" menu option. Alternatively, dragging and dropping the model's file into the Project Panel also works to import it into the project. Placing GameObjects and Adding Colliders Once the object is imported into the project, drag and drop it into the scene. Position it, scale it, and rotate it to the desired values. Once the object has been positioned, ensure that the object has a Collider component attached to it. This can be done by selecting the object, and pressing the \"Add Component\" button near the button of the Inspector. Objects can contain SphereCollider s, BoxCollider s, or MeshCollider s. SphereCollider s and BoxCollider s are preferred due to their simplicity and efficiency, so prefer these two colliders when possible. If the object in question has a more complex shape, a MeshCollider can be used. Read the Unity documentation for MeshCollider components to see details on how to configure the component. After the desired collider has been added to the object, modify the collider to ensure it surrounds the entirety of the object. These collision bounds will be used in following steps to ensure the object is correctly blocked out on the Nav Mesh. Marking GameObjects as Static After placing your GameObjects wherever you wish to create your environment, the only requirement is that every object in the environment that should block agents from passing through it (walls, queues, pillars, food lockers, tables, chairs etc.) MUST be marked as static. To mark any GameObject as static, ensure the Static checkbox is checked. The Static checkbox is located in the top right corner of the inspector for the current GameObject selected, to the right of the GameObject's name textbox. If the GameObject has children GameObject's, ensure those are marked as static as well. Any GameObject that does not directly block agents (such as PenaltyArea s ) should NOT be marked as static, as this should only be done for solid, blocking objects. Rebaking the Nav Mesh To rebake the Nav Mesh, first ensure all GameObjects in the scene that should block agents are marked as static . Next, open the Navigation window. This can be found via Unity's menu bar (Window>AI>Navigation). Select the Bake tab in the Navigation window. Leave the settings as they are, and click the Bake button at the bottom of the Navigation window. If done correctly, all walkable areas should be highlighted in blue, and all non-walkable areas should not be highlighted at all. Configure Pathfinding Grid Once the Nav Mesh has been rebaked, the Pathfinding Grid needs to be reconfigured. The Pathfinding Grid allows the agents to move from point to point and works with the Nav Mesh to provide accurate pathfinding. First, locate the GameObject with the name \"A*\", which can be found in the hierarchy. There should only be a single component attached to it, called Pathfinder . If a grid is not seen overlaid across your simulation environment in the Unity Scene window, scroll to the bottom of the \"A*\" GameObject and ensure the option Show Graphs is set to true . Once the grid has been located, position it near the center of the simulation environment. After it is positioned, increase or decrease the grid size so that the entire simulation environment is covered. This can be done by changing the Width (nodes) and Depth (nodes) settings on the Pathfinder component. The grid should encompass the entire simulation environment, but it should not be any larger than necessary. Massively large grids are slower and less accurate than smaller ones. There are other settings on the Pathfinder that affect how the agents' pathfinding works, but these are all considered ADVANCED USER SETTINGS and should only be changed if the user is absolutely certain of what they are doing. Setting up the Simulation Camera Whenever a new environment for a simulation is created, the camera that views the simulation environment must be configured so all parts of the simulation are viewable. See CameraController for details. Setting up Waypoints Due to how the simulation works, waypoints are grouped into two categories: Starting/Ending Waypoints Main Waypoints Setting up Starting and Ending Waypoints To set up the starting and ending waypoints for the simulation, use the WaypointPlanner component . Setting up Main Waypoints To set up all main waypoints (any waypoint that is not a starting or ending waypoint), see Setting up Waypoints . Configuring Agent Spawn Rates To configure the rate and frequency in which agents spawn over the duration of the simulation, use the AgentSpawnConfig component . Pathfinding and Queue Formation Influencing One way to influence how agents pathfind from waypoint to waypoint and how queues are formed while agents wait for waypoints is with the PenaltyArea object . Time Control For more details about how to change the time scale of a simulation, see Time Control . Metrics To view and analyze metrics relating to the global state of the simulation, see Global Metrics . To view metrics specific to a single agent or waypoint, see Specific Metrics . To view visualizations of connections between waypoints and connections between a waypoint and it's sublocations, see Visualizations .

Num Agents Total agents that will spawn between Start Time of the spawn block, and the Start Time of the next block. Agent Spawn Rate Smoothness How \"smooth\" the agents will spawn throughout the duration of the spawn block. See Spawn Rate Smoothness for details. Spawn Rate Smoothness The value of Agent Spawn Rate Smoothness for an individual AgentSpawnBlock represents the minimum percentage of time within a spawn block that all agents could possible spawn. For example, let's say we have a spawn block with a start time of 10am, a duration of 1 hour, and 60 agents that should spawn within this spawn block. Internally, when a spawn block is processed, the variable maxTimeBetweenAgents is created to represent the max time that can pass before another agent must spawn in order to ensure all agents are spawned within the duration of a spawn block. With 60 agents over a 1 hour spawn block, that means that an agent must spawn, at most, every 1 minute. Spawn rate smoothness simply represents a percentage of the maxTimeBetweenAgents for the lower bound of the time range for when an agent must be spawned in. This range is then selected from at random. If spawn rate smoothness was 1, then the lower bound for an agent's spawn rate is 100% of maxTimeBetweenAgents , which gives us a random time between 1 minute and 1 minute (which is of course just 1 minute always, as you cannot select a random number between just one number). If the spawn rate smoothness was 0.1, then the lower bound for an agent's spawn rate is 10% of maxTimeBetweenAgents , which gives us a random time between 6 seconds and 1 minute. This means that with a smoothness of 0.1, and 60 agents spawning over 1 hour, all 60 agents will spawn between 6 minutes at the lower bound, and 1 hour at the upper bound. Randomness will determine how close to either of these bounds the simulation actually comes. In summary, the lower spawn rate smoothness, the most \"clumped together\" agents may spawn.
