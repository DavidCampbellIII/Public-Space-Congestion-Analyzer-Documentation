# Time Control

The time scale of a simulation can be modified while the simulation is running in order to speed up or slow down agent processing.

The time scale of a simulation is currently limited from 1x to 10x real-time.

## How to Change the Time Scale

To change the time scale, first make sure the simulation is running.  Then locate the Time Control Panel in the upper left corner of the simulation.

Pressing the double forward arrows icon will increase the simulation time scale by 1.5x, up to a max of 10x real-time.

Pressing the double backward arrows icon will decrease the simulation time scale by 1.5x, down to a min of 1x real-time.

Pressing the play button icon will set the time scale to 1x (real-time).

Pressing the pause button icon will set the time scale to 0x, which pauses the simulation.  To resume the simulation, simply press the play button.

## Viewing Time Scale Effects

The effects of changing the time scale are obvious, as agents will process, wait, and move at a rate equal to the time scale.

The current time of the simulation, which is right above the time control buttons on the Time Control Panel, also shows the speed in which time is progressing.
