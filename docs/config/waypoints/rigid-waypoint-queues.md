# RigidWaypointQueues

## How to Locate

The `RigidWaypointQueue` component is located on the any GameObject with a name containing "RigidQueue".  They require [`LerpableLine` components](lerpable-lines.md) to be on the same GameObject.

## How to Set Up

To create a new `RigidWaypointQueue`, simply create a GameObject and add a `RigidWaypointQueue` component and [`LerpableLine` component](lerpable-lines.md) to it.  Another option is duplicating an existing `RigidWaypointQueue`.

No additional work is required to configure a `RigidWaypointQueue`.  Simply assign nodes as you would any other [`LerpableLine`s](lerpable-lines.md).
